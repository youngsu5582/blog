Automated Workflow Testing

This post has been written to test the newly established blog automation system.

Testing Procedure

1. When an issue is created, a Pull Request should be automatically generated shortly thereafter.
2. When a review label is added to the generated PR, the post should be translated into English and the file structure should change.
3. Finally, when a complete label is added to the PR, both the PR and the issue should be closed and the branch should be deleted.

Make sure that all these processes proceed smoothly.
