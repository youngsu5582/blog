### Mission 1

```
1. Reviewer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: It was very good that you left questions about what you were curious about through comments.
If the reviewee doesn't understand what the reviewer wants, they can only leave abstract reviews, but Joysun pointed out what he wanted, which made it easier to review.
This can be very helpful for technical development as both the reviewee and the reviewer become aware of the parts they need to focus on.
It would be good if you continue to use the same method as now.
Despite being new to development using Spring, you seem to have written the code well overall.
It seems like you read a lot of books, and it would be good to read more various books and learn about various perspectives.
It seems like you had a lot of concerns at the code level, but it would be good to pay more attention to other areas starting from Level 2.
Development is not just about writing code, so it would be good to build up a balanced knowledge of overall CS, such as DB and network.

- Soft Skills Feedback: It was good that you actively asked questions about what you were curious about through DM.

2. Peer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: Since you had previous web development experience, it was easy to learn and solve missions together.
Also, you thought deeply about even minor details and tried to create better results.

- Soft Skills Feedback: Joysun clearly communicated his opinions, which made it easy to understand.
And it was good to see you trying to create better results through active communication.
```
### Mission 2

```
1. Reviewer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: I was impressed by your efforts to study a lot about testing and apply it to the mission, such as separating the test environment and operating environment, test settings, and slice tests/integration tests.
You appropriately handled exceptions for possible exceptional situations using ControllerAdvice, ExceptionHandler, and custom exceptions.
However, it may be necessary to be wary of the excessive increase in custom exceptions.

- Soft Skills Feedback: Despite being busy preparing for the Tecotalk presentation, you did not neglect the mission and worked hard.
If there were issues such as late submission, you informed me via DM, so I could quickly grasp the situation.
Your explanations of questions and your thoughts were specific, which made them easy to understand.

2. Peer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: You have clear standards when developing and actively ask questions to reviewers or coaches.
Because you have these strengths, I think you will be able to quickly improve your development skills.

- Soft Skills Feedback: You also pay close attention to communication during pair programming.
It can be physically exhausting or tense when creating a mission in a short period of time, but you maintain the atmosphere so that it doesn't happen. You conduct discussions with core content.
You also clearly convey your opinions on topics that are prone to long conversations due to trade-offs or areas of choice. Thanks to this, I was able to do pair programming at a fast pace.
```

### Mission 3

```
1. Reviewer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: While giving and receiving feedback, I already conveyed this, but it would be good to try to find arguments with solid grounds rather than approaching it from the perspective of current industry practices or finding the right answer.

- Soft Skills Feedback: I was impressed by your active communication and your efforts to resolve your curiosities.

You appropriately considered the feedback given and clearly presented your arguments.

2. Peer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: Your clear development style is a strength, allowing you to quickly add implementations or solve problems. 
Also, I think it's good that you constantly try to find better ways beyond simple methods and constantly think about them.
Although you started Spring and JPA for the first time in Level 2, I think you will quickly become good at it. I think it will be enough if you continue as you are now.

- Soft Skills Feedback: While doing the mission, it was good that you kept communicating your desired direction. However, there were times when you couldn't easily say what you really wanted, considering the other person, but I think it's okay not to do that too much.
```
### Mission 4
```
1. Reviewer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: You implemented it very well. I didn't know you would even change the DB table structure, but I was surprised that you did. You seem to have a lot of passion and good skills.

- Soft Skills Feedback: The comments you left were easy to read, making it easy to understand what you were thinking about, and I felt that you had thought about various things.

2. Peer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: It was good to see you trying to apply various attempts to the code. Thanks to this, I was able to consider what a good structure and code are while collaborating. You are already working hard to improve your development skills, so I think you are excellent with no specific feedback to leave!

- Soft Skills Feedback: While pair programming, you gave various opinions, and it was easy to understand because you spoke with your own grounds. It was good that I learned how to express my opinions with my own grounds.
