### Mission 1
```

1. Reviewer Feedback
- Development Competency Feedback: I think you wrote the code and reflected the feedback in accordance with the requirements and learning objectives of the Level 1 car game.
  Basically, you seem to have sufficient code writing skills to perform the mission.

What was disappointing was that some parts, such as conventions that I thought were fully understood in the pre-course, were insufficient.
It would be good if you could definitely learn and apply this part to your code, as it can be the most basic part of writing code and something you should continue to follow in the future.

However, I think it's very good that you actively accept and perform the parts I give feedback on or for additional learning.
I still feel that the design part according to the responsibility and role of the object is lacking, but I thought that this part can be improved quickly by writing various codes.
Instead of thinking in the order of simply creating a field and creating a method to use the field when implementing an object, it would be more helpful to change the order to think about what responsibility the domain should have and what actions it should perform, and then create the object, field, and method accordingly.

- Soft Skills Feedback: While giving feedback, you explained well what you were curious about, how you understood the feedback I gave, and what parts you were additionally curious about or didn't understand, so I was able to review it without difficulty.
In particular, it was very good that you organized and shared what you learned well and showed the code reflection accordingly.
If you show that you are applying what you have learned in this way, it can be a good skill that can persuade others in future code writing.


2. Peer Feedback
- Development Competency Feedback: I think it would be okay to worry a little less about method and variable names.
- Soft Skills Feedback: You were kind enough to explain the parts that your pair didn't know, and you didn't seem bothered.
I think you should consider this your strength and develop it further.
```
### Mission 2
```
1. Reviewer Feedback  
- Development Competency Feedback: There were many comments about the cooperative relationship between objects, and
I was impressed that you realized it yourself and reflected it!
I look forward to seeing you skillfully utilize the cooperative relationship between objects in the next mission!

- Soft Skills Feedback: It was good to ask for my opinion :)
I didn't give you the right answer to your question, but instead gave my opinion indirectly or asked you back because
I thought that if I spoke my opinion strongly or said it was the right answer, Joysun's thoughts might become rigid.
I don't think I'm the right answer, so I was curious about what direction Joysun was thinking in :)
I hope that in the future missions, you will also explore your own path!


2. Peer Feedback  
- Development Competency Feedback: Your habit of writing clean code looks good.
  And I think it would be okay to relieve some of the pressure for a smoother code writing and development process.
- Soft Skills Feedback: Your clear personal standards are a strength, leading to a straightforward code writing process.
  And in collaborative code writing, presenting your standards based on slightly more clear grounds will be helpful for smooth communication in the long run.
```
### Mission 3
```
1. Reviewer Feedback
- Development Competency Feedback: I was impressed by your various attempts, such as applying the State pattern or experimenting with changing interfaces/enums to group logic with the same role.
  It is also good that you are actively practicing the immutable objects, first-class collections, domain layer protection, primitive value wrapping, and TDD that are emphasized in Wooteco.

- Soft Skills Feedback: You were the most inquisitive and curious crew member I have reviewed so far.
  Your attitude was friendly and your desire to resolve your curiosity was strong, which was good to see.
  However, asking questions is also a skill, and your questions were a bit lengthy. I expect you to become more proficient as you continue to ask many questions in the future.

1. Summarize the content of your question in one line.
- Summarize the content that the other person ultimately needs to answer in one line.
2. Think about whether the structure is one that the other person can answer.
3. Make it a habit to Google before asking a question (the quality of your question will improve if you ask after searching and synthesizing the information).

That being said, I hope you don't find asking questions too difficult and continue to ask many questions as you do now. I think you will either become a question mark murderer or someone great.


2. Peer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: You are really, really good at handling streams. I'm surprised every time I see it.
  I should definitely study streams too. But please be a little more generous with our for loops...ㅎ

I really want to emulate your habit of studying in your spare time even when you are busy.
Seeing Joysun reading a book next to me makes me feel more motivated to study too.
And I was also very grateful that you didn't get frustrated and explained things slowly even though I was much slower than Joysun ㅎㅎ

- Soft Skills Feedback: Sometimes you are so fast that it is hard to keep up.
  I think it's especially like that when you are really focused, and it's something to be admired, but it's a little difficult when we are pairing.
  Of course, someone with similar skills to Joysun would be able to keep up without any problems, but for someone like me who has a much larger skill gap,
  there were times when I couldn't keep up and just stared blankly without realizing it..
  
But it was really great that you explained it in detail after such a fast-paced session.
So I was able to follow along until the end even if I missed some parts in the middle.
Also, when I was the driver, it was good that you waited for me to think for myself and then gave me feedback, rather than just telling me to do this or that.
```
### Mission 4
```
1. Reviewer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: If the mission is very difficult, please ask the coaches for advice or help. It is true that it is difficult to do it within the time limit, but since studying and work are not always easy, I hope you will practice a lot in future missions.

- Soft Skills Feedback: It is great to see you actively asking questions. It would be even better if you review the question after writing it to see if the other person can understand it and then refine it.

2. Peer Feedback

- Development Competency Feedback: Joysun, your meticulous consideration of each function and variable name while coding was truly impressive. Maintaining this thorough habit will be a great asset to your growth.

- Soft Skills Feedback: Although we only spent a short time together (2-3 days), it was very enjoyable and we were able to create code with a lot of laughter. However, I don't think you need to be so sorry for the little things!!
